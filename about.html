            <p>
                I am currently a student at the University of Oklahoma, pursuing a degree in MIS.
                I have a strong interest in Web Development, Cyber Security, Databases, and Data Science and plan to graduate fall of 2024.
                Throughout my academic journey, I have gained many valuable skills, and I am always eager to learn and explore new things.
